Question:
- How would you test the word count program?
- What kinds of input are most likel yto uncover bugs if there are any?
*/


/*
Answer 1:

- I would test the word count program simply by writing a lot of phrases and character combinations to see if it would
 work.
*/


/*
Answer 2:

- If there are any bugs, I think the input that would most likely find them is if the input included the symbols that
 are being compared. This would include:
 - \n
 - \t

Where these characters are not code to be interpreted as valid C code, but as text.
